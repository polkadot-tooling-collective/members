about: Mechanical Engineering Bachelors, polkadot fellowship member, previous maintainer 
  of sc-simnode.
  Started my journey in the ecosystem in 2021, with initial PRs to polkadot, 
  cumulus and substrate.
motivation: Polkadot is the endgame for blockchain technologyâ€”a scalable, interoperable, 
  and secure ecosystem that empowers developers to create the next generation of decentralized applications. 
  More Web2 developers are migrating onchain and i would like to join the permissionless team easing that transition.
