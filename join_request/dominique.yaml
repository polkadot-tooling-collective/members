about: Hello, I am Dominique, and I am working at Parity since January 2022. I
  started as an Integration Support Engineer, helping (on the technical side)
  various exchanges, custodians, and wallets in integrating with the Polkadot
  ecosystem. Currently, my focus is more on the tooling side, and I am a
  maintainer of the Substrate-API-Sidecar. I have also helped to various
  Polkadot hackathons and participated in educational Deep Dive videos. Before
  joining Parity, I was coding in C, object-oriented Python, and (regrettably)
  PHP, and also worked in Data Analytics positions. I studied Computer Science
  in Athens, Greece and started a Business Finance degree which I haven't
  completed since I moved abroad. I have a strong interest in code testing and
  code security.
motivation: My motivation for joining the Tooling Fellowship is to further
  contribute to the tooling side of Polkadot, so that these tools help/support
  other teams in integrating with the ecosystem. The open-source nature of all
  the code in Polkadot repositories aligns deeply with my values. I also believe
  that increasing the number of non-male contributors can bring a positive and
  valuable impact to the ecosystem.
